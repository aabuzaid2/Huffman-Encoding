# Huffman-Encoding
THIS PROGRAM WAS RUN AND TESTED IN A LINUX ENVIRONMENT USING G++ COMMANDS.

The parameters are as follows, 1 for compression and 0 for decompression. The decompression command only understands the output generated by the compression code.

To compress a message you need to write the required message in a text file called "message.txt", and run the code with the compress parameter with the file in the same directory, in that file, the message is deleted and instead the new encoded message is written along with the alphabet with their respective encoding.

The example attached in "message.txt" is from the message input abcacdadad

Then when the decompression code is run another file named "output" is generated with the original message.

Also, in the command line screen, the compression ratio and encoding efficiency are outputted to the screen when the compression parameter is passed

and when the decompression parameter is passed the alphabet used and their corresponding encoding is outputted to the screen.
